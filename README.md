## ✨ Features

- 🌧️ **Matrix Rain**: Experience the famous "Matrix" digital rain effect right in your terminal
- 🧫 **Conway's Game of Life**: Watch the classic cellular automaton evolve before your eyes
- 🧩 **Maze Generation**: Get lost in procedurally generated mazes
- 🐦 **Boids**: Witness the emergent flocking behavior of these simulated birds
- 🧊 **3D Cube**: Renders a rotating 3D cube using terminal graphics with braille patterns for higher resolution.
- 🦀 **Crab**: Animated crabs walking across your screen, interacting with each other and the environment.
- 🍩 **Rotating Donut**: A mesmerizing rotating donut rendered in the terminal
- 🚰 **Pipes**: Watch pipes flow with a smooth animation
- 🔥 **Fire**: A cozy fireplace effect to warm up your terminal

## 🚀 Installation

Install directly using cargo:

```bash
cargo install tarts
```

or you can use it like a library for your own TUI app!

### Nix

This repository also provides a nix flake:

```bash
nix run github:oiwn/tarts -- matrix
```

## 🛠️ Usage

To use the screen savers, run the executable with the desired screen saver's name as an argument:

```bash
tarts matrix  # The classic digital rain effect
tarts life    # Conway's Game of Life
tarts maze    # Watch a maze generate itself
tarts boids   # Bird-like flocking simulation
tarts cube    # 3d rotating cube using braille patterns
tarts crab    # Ferris the crab with collisions
tarts donut  # Rotating donut
tarts pipes  # Pipes effect
tarts fire   # Fire effect
```

Press `q` or `Esc` to exit (or even Ctrl+C).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Not implemented yet. I think it should be toml file where you can set options for effects.

## 🧪 Development

This project uses standard Rust tooling:

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Benchmark performance
cargo bench
```
