# 🦀 TARTS: Terminal Arts 🎨

> **BLAZINGLY FAST** terminal screensavers written in Rust!

`tarts` (shortcut from **T**erminal **Arts**) is a collection of **MEMORY SAFE**
terminal-based screen savers that bring visual delight to your command line.
Built with **ZERO-COST ABSTRACTIONS**, these screen savers run efficiently while
providing stunning visual effects.

## ✨ Features

- 🌧️ **Matrix Rain**: Experience the famous "Matrix" digital rain effect right in your terminal
- 🧫 **Conway's Game of Life**: Watch the classic cellular automaton evolve before your eyes
- 🧩 **Maze Generation**: Get lost in procedurally generated mazes
- 🐦 **Boids**: Witness the emergent flocking behavior of these simulated birds
- 🧊 **3D Cube**: Renders a rotating 3D cube using terminal graphics with braille patterns for higher resolution
- 🦀 **Crab**: Animated crabs walking across your screen, interacting with each other and the environment
- 🍩 **Rotating Donut**: A mesmerizing rotating donut rendered in the terminal
- 🚰 **Pipes**: Watch pipes flow with a smooth animation
- 🔥 **Fire**: A cozy fireplace effect to warm up your terminal
- ⚡ **Plasma**: Electric plasma effect with vibrant colors and smooth animations
- 🎯 **Blank**: Simple blank screen with minimal resource usage
